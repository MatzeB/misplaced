Story
-----
It's a cooperative multiplayer game: A bunch of people is stranded on an island and wants to attract the search crews by creating a big SOS-sign. However not everyone cooperates, some people decided that they would rather stay on the island and enjoy the sun and the coconuts without it being found.

Game
----

After joining the server and all players indicated they are ready the game
starts. One third of the players will randomly selected as "evil" players, the
others are "nice" players. The true attitude of the players is not revealed
until the end. You may only guess based on their actions.

The goal of the nice players is to collect wood and build an SOS sign before
the time is up. They might also stun players they assume of being evil.

The goal for the evil guys is to prohibit/distract the nice guys from reaching
their goal in time.
